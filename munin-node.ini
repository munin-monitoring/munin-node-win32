[PerfCounterPlugin_uptime]
; This is a section for the Performance Counter plugin
; The Object and Counter settings are used to access the Performance Counter
; For uptime this would result in \System\System Up Time
; The Graph settings are reported to munin
; The DropTotal setting will drop the last instance from the list, which is often _Total
; Has no effect on single instance counters (Uptime)
; The CounterFormat setting controls what format the counter value is read in as a double, int, or large (int64).
; If CounterFormat = int - then munin will output integer formatted numbers so that DERIVE can work. 
; The CounterMultiply setting sets a value the counter value is multiplied by, use it to adjust the scale
; 1.1574074074074073e-005 is the result of(1 / 86400.0), the uptime counter reports seconds and we want to report days.
; So we want to divide the counter value by the number of seconds in a day, 86400.

;CounterType allows specifying the RRD type for the series (this is case sensitive). DERIVE is particularly  handy
;If you use derive then you need to set CounterFormat to int because RRD wont do DERIVE for floats.
;this also automatically sets your counter.min = 0 - becuase this is reccomended.
